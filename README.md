## about
This game is a clone of the minigame [that was at the beginning of FNAF 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kI7QTIjIwcg). You control freddy, who is trying to give the kids some pizza in a time limit.
## how to play
You can design pizza in the **Design Pizza** menu option.

You control the character, a freadbear, with **WASD or arrow keys**. You can shoot pizza with **SPACE**. Your task is to feed all kids before the deadline, represented by a rectangle on top of the screen. Each of the kids has **5 hunger** - hence, to be fed, they have to be hit 5 times with the pizza. The amount of kids gradually increase. Beginning on the second stage, you will also have another nuisance - a **shadow freddy** who is very greedy and wants all the pizza for himself. He will follow you and when hit with pizza, he will eat it. How long will you survive?
